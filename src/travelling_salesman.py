"""
This is the top level module for the project.
The goal is to import functionality from a suite of modules to achieve modularity and quick prototyping.
As such this module should read only at a very high level of abstraction

Note: For the initial comit a number of demo methods have been written to show proposed workflow.
Anything with "DEMO" in it's name is obviously not a proper implementation and will be removed
